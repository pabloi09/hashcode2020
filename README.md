# Hash Code 2020
This year, we participated in our first Hash Code. We lacked in organization and run out of time to upload all the files. Nevertheless, we achieved the 5,698th out of 10,724 teams. If we had uploaded all the files on time we would have become the 3,061th position (not bad thought). 

I upload this solution for the record. However, I know there is some optimization needed to get better times of execution and better score. The winner's score was 27,203,691 and ours gets a score of 22,998,729. 

It was very fun and I think that our team has a lot of potential!
